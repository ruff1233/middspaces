#  MiddSpaces

This project was created by Emma Doubman and Paul Ruffolo for their Senior Seminar project for the Computer Science major at Middlebury College. This application can be run locally to create reservations for the most sought after study spaces in the college's Bicentennial Hall. The goal of this project was for the creators to learn about web development, particularly with React and how to connect and utilize a database along with it.
